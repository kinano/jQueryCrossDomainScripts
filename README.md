# Price Fetcher
I had to solve the following problem:

Fetch the price of a commodity from a vendor website(the price changes frequently) and display the price on a friend's website.

The owners of the website we are fetching the price from have given us permission to query their website.

Unfortunately, they do not have programming resources to provide an API that we could call.

# Limitations: 
Cannot use any server side programming languages. Only HTML and JS.

# Live site:
